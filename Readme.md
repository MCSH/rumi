# Rumi

> Everything you possess of skill, and wealth, and handicraft, wasn't it first merely a thought and a quest? - Rumi

Rumi is a low level compiler with functional properties that can be linked with c, doesn't make local functions a nightmare and has a powerful compile time language that is the same as runtime. The ultimate goal of rumi is to make programming joyful.

The current version is written in C++, however the previous versions were written in rumi and C++ respectively. We use LLVM to compile.

Language documentation could be find [here](https://github.com/rumi-lang/docs).
