# Rumi

This project is no longer maintained. 

I find it difficult to allocate time to it, but it has already served its purpose as a proof of concept: the program can change a static compiler's behavior as it compiles it, using the same syntax.

Rumi is a low level compiler with functional properties that can be linked with c, doesn't make local functions a nightmare and has a powerful compile time language that is the same as runtime. The ultimate goal of rumi is to make programming joyful.

The current version is written in C++, however the previous versions were written in rumi and C++ respectively. We use LLVM to compile.

Language documentation could be find [here](https://github.com/rumi-lang/docs).
